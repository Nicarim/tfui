# TFUI - Terraform Terminal UI

Rename terraform state with ease and sanity.

Problem that I had is that if I had to rename multiple resources in terraform state it was always... cumbersome.
So I came up with idea to make that easier, faster and slick. 
I present you TFUI - Terraform Terminal UI (or Terraform UI for short)

Nothing to show yet but here is recording of what is it doing now
